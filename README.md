# Networking Knowledge Repository

Welcome to my **Networking Knowledge Repository**! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for theory and practical labs on various networking technologies including **Routing**, **Switching**, **Firewalls**, **Load Balancers**, **Zscaler**, and more. Whether you're preparing for certifications, diving deep into advanced networking topics, or learning hands-on configurations, you'll find valuable resources here.

## Introduction

This project aims to cover various aspects of networking, providing both **theoretical explanations** and **practical lab setups**. The focus is on real-world configurations and troubleshooting skills, which are critical for network engineers and IT professionals.

I will regularly update this repository with new topics, configurations, labs, and troubleshooting guides across different networking domains.

## Technologies Covered

- **Routing**: BGP, OSPF, EIGRP, RIP, Static Routing, Route Redistribution, etc.
- **Switching**: VLANs, STP, VTP, EtherChannel, Port Security, and more.
- **Firewalls**: Cisco ASA, Palo Alto, Check Point, Fortinet, etc.
- **Load Balancers**: F5, Citrix ADC, HAProxy, etc.
- **SD-WAN**: Cisco Viptela, VMware VeloCloud, etc.
- **Zscaler**: ZIA (Zscaler Internet Access), ZPA (Zscaler Private Access).
- **Network Security**: VPN, ACL, IPS/IDS.
- **Automation**: Python for networking, Ansible, NETCONF/RESTCONF.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into multiple directories based on the technologies and topics:

```
├── Routing/
│   ├── Theory/
│   ├── Labs/
│   ├── BGP/
│   ├── OSPF/
│   └── EIGRP/

└── NetworkAutomation/
    ├── Python/
    └── Ansible/
```

Each directory contains subdirectories for **Theory** (detailed explanations, notes) and **Labs** (practical configurations, examples, and scenarios).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amannkrmishra/Routing-Switching.git
   ```
   
2. **Explore different topics**: Browse through the directories to find the theory or lab files you are interested in.

3. **Practice Labs**: Each lab folder contains configuration files, topologies, and step-by-step guides. You can use simulators like **GNS3**, **EVE-NG**, or physical devices to follow along.

4. **Contributions**: Feel free to contribute by submitting **pull requests** for topics you feel need improvement or additional content.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! Here’s how you can help:

- Create new labs or topics.
- Improve existing explanations or configurations.
- Share feedback or troubleshooting tips for different scenarios.
- Update or correct any outdated material.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-topic`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some new-topic'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-topic`).
