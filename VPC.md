# Virtual Port Channel (vPC) Overview
- Purpose
  - Allows links physically connected to two different Cisco Nexus switches to appear as a single port channel
- Benefits
  - **Increased Bandwidth**: Utilizes all available uplink bandwidth
    - Up to 2x the bandwidth of traditional designs
  - **Improved Redundancy**: Eliminates Spanning Tree blocked ports
    - Active-active forwarding on all links
  - **Enhanced Availability**: Provides active-active Layer 2 topology
    - Sub-second failover in most scenarios
- History and Evolution
  - Introduced by Cisco for Nexus switches in NX-OS 4.1(4)
  - Similar to technologies like Multichassis EtherChannel (MEC) and Virtual Link Trunking (VLT)

# vPC Fundamentals
- **Core Components**
  - vPC Domain: Logical entity spanning two switches (1-1000)
  - Peer-Keepalive Link: Layer 3 link for heartbeat (UDP port 3200)
  - Peer Link: Layer 2 link for control and data traffic (typically 10G+)
  - vPC Member Ports: Ports participating in vPC (up to 528 vPCs per domain)
- **vPC Roles**
  - Primary Switch: Handles STP BPDUs and ARP requests
  - Secondary Switch: Forwards BPDUs and ARP requests to primary
- **vPC Consistency Check**
  - Type 1 Parameters (must match)
    - e.g., VLAN list, STP mode, MST configuration
  - Type 2 Parameters (recommended to match)
    - e.g., MAC aging timers, LACP mode
- **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Behavior**
  - Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) forwarding
    - Only primary switch sends BPDUs
  - Root bridge election considerations
    - vPC domain appears as a single logical switch

# vPC Configuration
- **vPC Domain Configuration**
  - Domain ID (must match on both switches): 1-1000
  - System Priority: 1-65535 (default 32667)
- **Peer-Keepalive Link Setup**
  - Dedicated link for vPC peer detection
    - Recommended bandwidth: 1Gbps
    - Latency: <5ms round-trip time
- **Peer Link Configuration**
  - Typically a port channel interface
    - Recommended: At least 2x10G links
    - Must be trunk port with allowed VLANs
- **vPC Member Port Configuration**
  - Creating and assigning vPCs to interfaces
    - vPC number range: 1-4096

# vPC Operations
- **vPC Role Election**
  - Primary vs Secondary determination
    - Based on vPC role priority (lower value wins)
    - If tied, lower MAC address wins
  - Role stickiness and preemption
    - sticky bit: Maintains role after reload
- **Dual-Active Detection**
  - Peer-Keepalive link failure handling
    - Detection time: Typically 3-5 seconds
- **Graceful Consistency Check**
  - Ensuring configuration consistency between peers
    - Periodic checks every 1 second
- **Orphan Ports**
  - Handling single-attached devices in vPC environment
    - Suspend orphan ports on secondary in case of peer-link failure
- **vPC Peer Gateway**
  - Allowing a vPC switch to act as the active gateway
    - Avoids hair-pinning for router MAC addressed traffic

# vPC Design Considerations

  - vPC interactions with various STP versions (RPVST+, MST)
    - Recommend using MST for large-scale deployments
- **First-Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRP)**
  - Integrating HSRP, VRRP with vPC
    - Use HSRP/VRRP version 2 for faster convergence
- **Multi-Pod and Multi-Site Design**
  - Extending vPC across data centers or pods
    - Consider Cisco OTV or VXLAN for DCI

# vPC Failure Scenarios and Recovery
- **Peer-Keepalive Link Failure**
  - Impact: No immediate effect if peer-link is up
  - Recovery: Automatic when link is restored

  - Recovery time: Typically <1 second
- **vPC Member Port Failure**
