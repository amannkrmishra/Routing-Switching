# Virtual Port Channel (vPC) Overview
- Purpose
  - Allows links physically connected to two different Cisco Nexus switches to appear as a single port channel
- Benefits
  - **Increased Bandwidth**: Utilizes all available uplink bandwidth
  - **Improved Redundancy**: Eliminates Spanning Tree blocked ports
  - **Enhanced Availability**: Provides active-active Layer 2 topology
- History and Evolution
  - Introduced by Cisco for Nexus switches
  - Similar to technologies like Multichassis EtherChannel (MEC) and Virtual Link Trunking (VLT)
