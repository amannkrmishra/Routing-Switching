# Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP) Overview
- **Purpose**
  - GLBP is a Cisco proprietary protocol that enables multiple routers to present themselves as a single virtual router, providing load balancing and redundancy for IP traffic.

- **Benefits**
  - **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across multiple routers, optimizing resource utilization.
  - **High Availability**: Provides redundancy by allowing multiple routers to act as a single virtual router.
  - **Scalability**: Supports large network environments with up to **1024 GLBP groups**, each having **up to 1024 virtual routers**.

- **History and Evolution**
  - Developed by Cisco in the late 1990s to enhance the functionality of previous redundancy protocols such as HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol), offering enhanced load balancing capabilities.

# GLBP Fundamentals
- **Core Components**
  - **Active Virtual Gateway (AVG)**: The router that responds to ARP requests for the virtual IP address and manages the group.
  - **Active Virtual Forwarders (AVFs)**: Routers that forward packets sent to the virtual IP address based on configured load balancing methods.
  - **GLBP Group**: A logical grouping of routers participating in GLBP that share a virtual IP address.

- **GLBP Operation**
  - **Load Balancing Methods**:
    - **Round Robin**: Distributes traffic evenly across AVFs.
    - **Weighted**: Allocates traffic based on assigned weights, allowing for better resource utilization.
    - **Host-dependent**: Directs traffic from specific hosts to the same AVF for session persistence.

- **GLBP Packet Structure**
  - GLBP packets include a header with fields such as:
    - **Protocol version**: Identifies the version of GLBP being used.
    - **Message type**: Defines the type of GLBP message (e.g., Hello, ARP response).
    - **Group number**: Identifies the GLBP group to which the message pertains.
    - **Virtual router MAC address**: Provides the MAC address for the virtual router.

# GLBP States and Message Exchanges
- **GLBP States**
  - **Initialize**: Initial state when the router is not part of a GLBP group.
  - **Listen**: The router is part of the GLBP group but is neither the AVG nor an AVF. It listens for GLBP messages.
  - **Speak**: The router is participating in AVG election and is eligible to become the AVG.
  - **Active**: The router is elected as the AVG and is responsible for forwarding ARP requests for the virtual IP.
  - **Standby**: The router is not the AVG but is ready to take over if the active AVG fails.

- **Message Exchanges**
  - GLBP uses **UDP** for message exchanges over **UDP port 3222**.
  - Key message types include:
    - **GLBP Hello Messages**: Sent periodically by routers to maintain membership in the GLBP group.
    - **GLBP ARP Response Messages**: The AVG responds to ARP requests with the MAC address of the selected AVF.

- **Hello Interval and Hold Time**
  - **Hello Interval**: Default is **3 seconds**; configurable from **1 to 255 seconds**.
  - **Hold Time**: Default is **10 seconds**; configurable from **1 to 255 seconds**.

# GLBP Configuration
- **Basic Configuration Steps**
  - **Enable GLBP on the Interface**:
    ```bash
    interface GigabitEthernet0/1
      glbp 1 ip 192.168.1.1
    ```
  - **Set the Priority for AVG Election**:
    ```bash
    glbp 1 priority 100
    ```
  - **Configure Load Balancing Method**:
    ```bash
    glbp 1 load-balancing weighted
    ```

- **Timers Configuration**
  - **Hello Interval**: Default 3 seconds; configurable from 1 to 255 seconds.
    ```bash
    glbp 1 hello interval 3
    ```
  - **Hold Time**: Default 10 seconds; configurable from 1 to 255 seconds.
    ```bash
    glbp 1 hold-time 10
    ```

# GLBP Operations
- **AVG Election Process**
  - Routers in a GLBP group elect the AVG based on priority values (higher values win). If tied, the router with the lowest MAC address becomes the AVG.

- **Traffic Forwarding**
  - The AVG responds to ARP requests for the virtual IP address, providing the MAC address of the appropriate AVF based on the load balancing method.

- **Failover Mechanism**
  - In case of AVG failure, a new AVG is elected, ensuring minimal downtime. The failover process typically takes < 3 seconds.

- **Message Types and Flow**
  - **GLBP Hello Messages**: Routers send these messages to establish their presence and maintain GLBP state.
  - **ARP Requests**: Sent by clients for the virtual IP, responded to by the AVG.
  - **ARP Responses**: Sent by the AVG to provide the MAC addresses of the AVFs.
