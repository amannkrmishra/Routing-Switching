# OSPF Fundamentals
- **Link-State Routing Protocol**
  - Each router maintains a complete topology map
- **Hierarchical Design**
  - Areas and Autonomous System (AS)
  - Scalability with Areas: Reduces routing table size and SPF calculations
- **Router ID** (Unique Identifier for Each Router)
  - 32-bit number, typically highest IP address or loopback
- **Cost Calculation**
  - Interface Cost (default values based on bandwidth)
  - **Reference Bandwidth** (default: **100 Mbps**)
  - Formula: Cost = Reference Bandwidth / Interface Bandwidth
- **Administrative Distance (AD)**
  - Default AD of **110**
  - Used for route preference when multiple routing protocols are present
- **OSPF Neighbor Adjacency**
  - Adjacency vs. Neighboring Relationship
  - **OSPF Neighbor States**: Down, Init, 2-Way, Exstart, Exchange, Loading, Full
