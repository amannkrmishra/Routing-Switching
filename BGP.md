# BGP Overview
- **Purpose**
  - BGP is an **inter-domain** routing protocol used to exchange routing information between different **Autonomous Systems (AS)**. It is the backbone of the internet, facilitating data exchange between different networks.

- **Benefits**
  - **Scalability**
    - Designed to handle thousands of routes; BGP is scalable for large networks.
  - **Policy-Based Routing**
    - Enables network administrators to define routing policies based on various attributes, such as AS path and local preference.
  - **Loop Prevention Mechanism**
    - Uses the **AS Path** attribute to prevent routing loops, ensuring that data does not circulate indefinitely.
  - **Multipath Support**
    - Supports multiple paths to the same destination, allowing for load balancing.

- **History and Evolution**
  - **BGP v1**: Initial specification (RFC 1105), used for exchanging routing information between ASes.
  - **BGP v2**: Introduced significant enhancements but was not widely adopted.
  - **BGP v3**: Implemented path vector mechanism, defined in RFC 1771.
  - **BGP v4**: Current version (RFC 4271), adds support for **Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)** and **multiprotocol extensions** for IPv6 (RFC 4760).

# BGP Fundamentals
- **Path Vector Protocol**
  - BGP uses a path vector mechanism to maintain the path information that gets updated dynamically as the network topology changes.
  
- **Autonomous System (AS)**
  - Unique identifier for networks under a single administrative control. Assigned by **IANA**, with a range of **1-64511** for public AS numbers and **64512-65535** for private use.
  
- **BGP Peering**
  - **Internal BGP (iBGP)**: Peering between routers within the same AS.
  - **External BGP (eBGP)**: Peering between routers in different ASes. Typically established over a **TCP connection** on **port 179**.

- **Router ID**
  - A unique identifier for each BGP router, usually the highest IP address on the router or manually configured. It's a 32-bit value (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).

- **Administrative Distance (AD)**
  - **20** for eBGP routes.
  - **200** for iBGP routes.
  - This determines the preference of the route source when multiple protocols are in use.

- **BGP Attributes**
  - **Weight**: Local to the router; higher values are preferred (default is **0**).
  - **AS Path**: A list of ASes that the route has traversed, used for loop prevention.
  - **Next Hop**: IP address of the next hop; crucial for forwarding.
  - **Local Preference**: Default is **100**; used to prefer paths within the AS.
  - **Multi-Exit Discriminator (MED)**: Default is **0**; lower values are preferred. Indicates to external neighbors which path to take into an AS.

# BGP Packet Types
- **Open Packet**
  - Used to establish a BGP session, includes the BGP version, AS number, hold time, and router ID.

- **Update Packet**
  - Advertises new routes or withdraws previously advertised routes, includes path attributes and NLRI (Network Layer Reachability Information).

- **Keepalive Packet**
  - Sent to maintain the BGP session and verify connectivity; sent at intervals defined by the hold timer.

- **Notification Packet**
  - Sent to indicate an error condition, includes an error code and sub-code, and closes the BGP session.

---

# BGP Neighbor Discovery
- **BGP Peering Establishment**
  - A TCP connection must be established before BGP sessions can be initiated.
  
- **BGP Neighbor States**
  - **Idle**: Waiting to connect.
  - **Connect**: Establishing a TCP connection.
  - **Active**: Trying to establish a connection.
  - **OpenSent**: Waiting for the Open packet.
  - **OpenConfirm**: Waiting for Keepalive.
  - **Established**: Fully established session for route exchange.

---

# BGP Route Selection Process
- **Route Selection Criteria**
  - **Weight** (higher preferred)
  - **Local Preference** (higher preferred)
  - **Locally Originated Routes** (routes originated by the router itself)
  - **AS Path Length** (shorter preferred)
  - **Origin Type**: IGP < EGP < Incomplete
  - **MED** (lower preferred)
  - **eBGP over iBGP** (eBGP routes preferred)
  - **Router ID** (lowest preferred as a tiebreaker)

---

# BGP Attributes
- **Mandatory Attributes**
  - **AS Path**: Essential for loop prevention.
  - **Next Hop**: Indicates the next hop IP address.
  - **Origin**: Indicates how the route was learned (IGP, EGP, or Incomplete).

- **Optional Attributes**
  - **Local Preference**: Used to influence outbound traffic.
  - **MED**: Suggests preferred entry point into an AS.
  - **Community**: Tagging mechanism for routing policies.

- **Transitive vs. Non-Transitive Attributes**
  - **Transitive**: Can be passed along by BGP speakers (e.g., AS Path).
  - **Non-Transitive**: Not passed along (e.g., Weight).

---

# BGP Policies
- **Route Filtering**
  - Control which routes are advertised or accepted using prefix lists, route maps, or access control lists (ACLs).

- **Route Redistribution**
  - Redistributing routes from other routing protocols into BGP.

- **BGP Community Strings**
  - Allow tagging of routes for easier manipulation and control.

---

# BGP Multipath and Load Balancing
- **ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path)**
  - BGP supports multiple paths to a destination when they have the same cost.
  
- **Load Balancing Techniques**
  - Per-packet or per-flow load balancing based on BGP attributes.

---

# BGP Scalability
- **Scalability Mechanisms**
  - **Route Aggregation**: Reducing the number of routes advertised to simplify routing tables.
  - **Route Reflectors**: Reducing iBGP session requirements; allows routers to reflect routes to other iBGP peers.
  - **Confederations**: Splitting an AS into smaller sub-ASes to manage routing within a larger organization.

---

# BGP Security
