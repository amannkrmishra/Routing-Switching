# Virtual Switching System (VSS) Overview

- **Purpose**
  - VSS allows two physical Cisco Catalyst switches to operate as a single logical switch, enhancing redundancy and simplifying management in enterprise networks.

- **Benefits**
  - **Increased Bandwidth**: Aggregates the uplink capacity of both switches.
    - Allows up to 2x the bandwidth compared to traditional single-switch designs.
  - **Improved Redundancy**: Eliminates STP blocked ports.
    - Active-active forwarding across all links.
  - **Simplified Management**: Single management interface for both switches.
    - Reduces complexity with a single IP address and a unified configuration.
  - **Enhanced Availability**: Active-active Layer 2 topology.
    - Sub-second failover in most scenarios.

- **History and Evolution**
  - Introduced by Cisco for Catalyst 4500 and 6500 series switches.
  - Similar to technologies like vPC but focuses on creating a single logical switch from two physical switches.

# VSS Fundamentals

- **Core Components**
  - **VSS Domain**: Logical entity comprising two switches.
    - Each switch can have multiple ports, typically supporting up to 4096 VLANs.
  - **Virtual Switch Link (VSL)**: A high-speed link connecting both switches for control and data traffic.
    - Typically a port channel interface, recommended to be at least **2x10 Gbps**.
    - Uses UDP port **3220** for control messages.
  - **Dual Supervisor Engines**: Two active supervisor engines providing redundancy.
    - Allows for hot standby capability.
  - **VSS Control Plane**: Shared control plane for both switches.
    - Synchronizes configurations in real-time.

- **VSS Roles**
  - **Active Switch (Primary)**: Handles control plane traffic, STP BPDUs, and ARP requests.
  - **Standby Switch (Secondary)**: Monitors the active switch and takes over if it fails.
  
- **VSS Consistency Check**
  - Ensures critical parameters are synchronized between switches.
  - **Type 1 Parameters (must match)**:
    - VLAN list, STP mode, MST configuration, port configurations.
  - **Type 2 Parameters (recommended to match)**:
    - MAC aging timers, LACP configuration, QoS settings.

- **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Behavior**
  - VSS appears as a single logical switch in STP.
  - Only the primary switch sends BPDUs to prevent loops.
  - **Root Bridge Election**: VSS domain acts as a single bridge in STP.

# VSS Configuration

- **VSS Domain Configuration**
  - **Domain ID**: Must match on both switches (1-1024).
  - **System Priority**: 1-65535 (default is 32768); lower value is preferred.

- **Virtual Switch Link Setup**
  - Recommended configuration includes:
    - Port channel interface as VSL.
    - Trunking enabled with allowed VLANs.
    - Minimum bandwidth of **10 Gbps**, latency <5ms for optimal performance.

- **VSS Member Port Configuration**
  - Configuring member ports to participate in VSS.
  - Supports both physical interfaces and port channels.
  - Example command to create VSL:
    ```bash
    interface Port-channel1
      switchport mode trunk
      switchport trunk allowed vlan all
    ```
  - Assign member ports:
    ```bash
    interface range GigabitEthernet1/0/1 - 2
      channel-group 1 mode active
    ```

# VSS Operations

- **Role Election**
  - Primary switch selection based on system priority; lower values take precedence.
  - In case of a tie, the switch with the lowest MAC address is elected.

- **Failover and Redundancy**
  - Sub-second failover is supported, ensuring minimal disruption.
  - If the primary switch fails, the secondary switch can take over in less than **200ms**.

- **Dual-Active Detection**
  - Mechanism to prevent both switches from becoming active simultaneously.
  - If VSL fails, member ports are suspended on the secondary switch to avoid loops.

- **Graceful Consistency Check**
  - Periodically checks and ensures configuration consistency every **1 second**.
  - Alerts administrators about mismatches.

# VSS Advanced Features

- **Layer 3 Features**
  - Supports routing protocols such as OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP.
  - Allows for IP routing and provides high availability.

- **Virtual Port Channel (vPC) Integration**
  - Can be combined with vPC configurations for multi-chassis setups.
  - Allows distributed and redundant Layer 2 networks.

- **VSS Peer Gateway**
  - Allows a switch to act as the active gateway.
  - Eliminates hairpinning issues for router MAC addressed traffic.

# VSS Design Considerations

- **Bandwidth Planning**
  - Ensure VSL and member ports have sufficient capacity.
  - VSL bandwidth should be at least equal to the sum of all member links.

- **VLAN Load Balancing**
  - Optimize traffic distribution across VSS members.
  - Use Layer 2 port-channel load balancing methods.

- **Spanning Tree Design**
  - Proper configuration of STP parameters is essential.
  - Recommend using Rapid PVST+ or MST for large-scale deployments.

- **First-Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRP)**
  - Integrate HSRP or VRRP for redundancy.
  - Use version 2 for faster convergence.

# VSS Failure Scenarios and Recovery

- **VSL Link Failure**
  - Impact: If the VSL fails, the secondary switch will suspend all member ports.
  - Recovery: Automatic upon restoration of the VSL.

- **Active Switch Failure**
  - Automatic takeover by the secondary switch with minimal service interruption.
  - Typically achieves convergence in <200ms.

- **Member Port Failure**
  - Traffic is rerouted, with minimal impact due to load balancing.
  - Convergence time is usually <100ms.

- **Dual-Active Scenario**
  - Implement dual-active detection to prevent split-brain scenarios.
  - Peer-link features ensure only one switch remains active.

# VSS Troubleshooting

- **Common Issues**
  - VSS not forming: Check VSL configuration and status.
  - Configuration inconsistencies: Verify Type 1 and Type 2 parameters.
  - Traffic black-holing: Inspect member ports for misconfigurations.

- **Diagnostic Commands**
  - `show vss`: Displays VSS status and configurations.
  - `show switch`: Provides details about the active and standby switches.
  - `show vsl`: Shows the status of the virtual switch link.

- **VSS Health Monitoring**
  - Set up SNMP traps or syslog alerts for VSS state changes.
  - Monitor VSS consistency and performance metrics.
